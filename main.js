// Hello challenger! Your task is to write a function named `getCapitalCity` that takes the Country and returns its capital. If the country doesn't exist/is not found or even if it is not spelled correctly then it needs to return a message saying 'Country not found'. You will be provided with a variable containing a countries and their capitals that was already created:

export const countries = {
  France: "Paris",
  Italy: "Rome",
  Japan: "Tokyo",
  Nigeria: "Abuja",
  Spain: "Madrid",
  Australia: "Canberra",
  Pakistan: "Islamabad",
  Germany: "Berlin",
};

// For example when you console.log:
// (getCapitalCity('Japan')); // It should return Tokyo
// (getCapitalCity(’India’)); // It should return Country not found.

export function getCapitalCity(country) {
  // Good luck! :)
}
